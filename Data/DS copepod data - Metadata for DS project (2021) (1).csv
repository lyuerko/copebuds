"Course Title: Applied Data Analysis in Marine Science, MRNE 475",,,
Semester: Fall term: September-December (2021),,,
Methods used to collect data: ,,,
"Using a turkey baster, we collected Tigriopus californicus from the tide pools at Scott's Bay (48°83′20″N, 125°14′95″W). Collected from two tidepools",,,
Methods of experiments:,,,
"Part 1 chronic DPH: 4 replicates x Control, 4 replicates x 100 ng/L of DPH, 4 replicates x 25 mg/L of DPH. Each replicate was in a test tube of 100 copepods and let sit for 5 days proior to experiment. Exposed to UVB light by alternating the top and bottom of the tube covered, 30 minutes each",,,
"Part 2: acute DPH: 4 replicates x Control, 4 replicates x 100 ng/L of DPH, 4 replicates x 25 mg/L of DPH. Each replicate was in a test tube of 100 copepods and exposed to the pollutant for 20 minutes. Exposed to UVB light by alternating the top and bottom of the tube covered, 30 minutes each",,,
"Part 3: acute lorazepam: 4 replicates x Control, 4 replicates x  689 ng/L of lorazepam, 4 replicates x 0.5 mg/L of lorazepam. Each replicate was in a test tube of 100 copepods and exposed to pollutant for 20 minutes prior to experiment. Exposed to UVB light by alternating the top and bottom of the tube covered, 30 minutes each",,,
Units of measurement:,,,
Time- minutes,,,
Copepods- number of copepods turned into proportions,,,
