Geographic information:,,,
"   -Collection of copepods:Scott’s Bay, Barkley Sound, British Columbia (48°83′20″N, 125°14′95″W)",,,
   -Housed in Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre in the Upper teaching lab sea tables,,,
   -Experimented on in Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre in the basement dark room,,,
Name of study: Diphenhydramine alters phototactic behavior of copepod Tigriopus californicus,,, 
"Course Title: Applied Data Analysis in Marine Science, MRNE 475",,,
Semester: Fall term: September-December (2021),,,
Methods used to collect data: ,,,
"   -Using a turkey baster, we collected Tigriopus californicus from the tide pools at Scott's Bay (48°83′20″N, 125°14′95″W). ",,,
    Collected from two tidepools,,,
Methods of experiments:,,,
"   -Part 1 chronic DPH: 4 replicates x Control, 4 replicates x 100 ng/L of DPH, 4 replicates x 25 mg/L of DPH. Each replicate ",,,
"    was in a test tube of 100 copepods and let sit for 5 days proior to experiment. Exposed to UVB light by alternating the top and bottom of the tube covered, 30 minutes each ",,,
"   -Part 2: acute DPH: 4 replicates x Control, 4 replicates x 100 ng/L of DPH, 4 replicates x 25 mg/L of DPH. Each replicate was ",,,
"     in a test tube of 100 copepods and exposed to the pollutant for 20 minutes. Exposed to UVB light by alternating the top and bottom of the tube covered, 30 minutes each",,,
"   -Part 3: acute lorazepam: 4 replicates x Control, 4 replicates x 689 ng/L of lorazepam, 4 replicates x 0.5 mg/L of lorazepam.",,,
"    Each replicate was in a test tube of 100 copepods and exposed to pollutant for 20 minutes prior to experiment. Exposed to UVB light by alternating the top and bottom of the tube covered, 30 minutes each",,,
Type of experimental units: ,,,
   -Control for each experiment (DPH chronic and acute exposure and lorazepam acute exposure),,,
   -Environmentally relevant concentration for each experiment,,,
   -High concentration for each experiment,,,
Units of measurement:,,,
   -Time- minutes,,,
   -Copepods- number of copepods turned into proportions (number of copepods showing positive phototaxis/total number of copepods in the tube),,,
Description of abbreviations:,,,
   -DPH: diphenhydramine,,,
Description of data in the columns:,,,
   -date_pollutant_added: This is the date that each concentration (environmentally relevant and high) were added to the tubes of copepods. ,,,
"     For the chronic DPH exposure, the concentrations were added 5 days prior to the experiment day. For the acut ezposure of lorazepam and DPH, the concentrations were added on the same day (20 minutes before)",,,
   -date_experiment: This is the day that the experiment was performed,,,
"   -replicate_number: This is the number of replicates. Each experiment had 4 replicates where 1 is the first replicate, 2 is the second, 3 is the third, and 4 is the fourth and final replicate.",,,
   -part_hidden: This is the section of the tube that was hidden from the UVB light during the experiments. We altered covering the top and bottom. ,,,
"     In this section, top under the part_hidden colum means the hop section of the tube was hidden, while bottom means the bottom half of the tube was covered.",,,
"   -treatment: This is the different treatments we used. We used 3 treatments, a control, environmentally relevant concentration, and a high concentration. ",,,
"     Under this colum the control is listed as control, the environmentally relevant concentration is listed as env_rel and the high concentration is listed as high. ",,,
"   -percentile: We labelled the tubes used into four equal sections. The very bottom is listed as 0-25, the next section is listed as 25-50.",,,
     This is where the middle of the tube is. The section after this is listed as 50-75 and the last section at the very top is listed as 75-100.,,,
"   -time_min: Each experiment lasted 30 minutes and we checked on the distribution of copepods every 5 minutes. This column lists the times 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 in minutes. ",,,
   -copepod_count: This is the number of copepods in each section of the tube at a certain time interval. ,,,
   -proportion: this is the proportion of copepods showing positive phototaxis over the number of total copepods in the tube. This was done in excel later on. ,,,
"     The total number of copepods was 100 for the most part, however, some died in the high concentration so we adjusted this so the total number of copepods in this treatment would represent the alive ones.",,,
