# Repository for the Directed Studies project and Applied Data Analysis course

This is the directed studies project that was designed and executed by Lyubava Erko and Carys Hughes at Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre. This work was done for the Applied Data Analysis and Directed Studies courses offered at the research station.

We observed the overall fitness of *Tigriopus californicus* when subjected to common wastewater pollutants, diphenhydramine and lorazpam, by using their phototactic response as a proxy. The copepods were exposed to the pollutants for acute and chronic durations.
